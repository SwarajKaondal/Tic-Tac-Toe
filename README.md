# Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository contains a Django-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The AI in this game uses the **Minimax algorithm** to calculate the best possible moves. The algorithm is optimized with **alpha-beta pruning**, which reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm, making the game faster and more efficient.

## Game

## How to Play
1. The game is displayed as a 3x3 grid.
2. You can choose to be either X or O.
3. The AI will automatically play as the opposing player using the Minimax algorithm
